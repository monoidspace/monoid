# 🧐 What is Monoid?

Monoid is a platform where you can build AI Agents directly on top of your APIs. Skip writing boilerplate code around LLMs and simply focus on optimizing your APIs and customizing your Agents. By giving Agents access to your APIs, they can:

- 🕵️‍♂️ **Fetch relevant context** about your problem or the user's request
- 🔁 **Take actions** on users' behalf

This platform has several features to make it painless to create AI Agents:

- 🔌 **Plug and play** with different LLMs and Agent Types with the click of a button
- 📬 **Postman-like interface** for turning your APIs into Actions, where you can choose which parameters the Agent controls
- 🏖️ **Action Sandbox** to "talk" to your API in natural language, where you can simulate an Agent who only has one Action
- 🤖 **Agent Sandbox** to simulate and test your AI Agent before you deploy it
- 🪆 **Use Agents as Actions** within other Agents, so that they can collaborate and solve more complex problems
- 🤝 **Action Hub and Agent Hub** to allow the community to share its creations and build off each other's work
